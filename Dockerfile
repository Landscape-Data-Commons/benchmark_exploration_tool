COPY app.R /srv/benchmark-histograms/
COPY instructions.html /srv/benchmark-histograms/

# No idea why this is here, it was inherited from an example
# It doesn't appear to be necessary but is here in case it needs to be reenabled later
# RUN sudo chown -R shiny:shiny /srv/benchmark-histograms

# Run app
# This makes sure that the app runs when the container is instanced
